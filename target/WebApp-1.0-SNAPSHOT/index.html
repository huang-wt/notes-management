<h2>Welcome to the Notes Manager App</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    This notes management web application is mainly designed for users to view and edit their collections of notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    It allows users to create new notes of the type text, image, url or the combination. Then, you can modify, delete,
    rename or search for any note from the list, simply by clicking the corresponding buttons and following the required
    steps.
    Also, users have options to sort the notes either in alphabetical or added (default) order.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, it is noted that there are some limits and required format if you want to insert an image or url. You need
    to start with the tag &lt;img&gt; or &lt;url&gt; followed by the hyperlink of the image or website you want to add
    in the context.
